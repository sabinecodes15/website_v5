        I'm a recent CS grad from the University of Chicago, and I'm passionate
        about making people's lives easier. I love leveraging my technical
        abilities to build clean, well-thought-out solutions for challenging,
        irritating, and inconvenient problems. Having a multitude of
        technological interests, I tend to gravitate toward roles related to
        full stack and cloud infrastructure development. I'm not afraid to wear
        multiple hats or learn new skillsâ€” I'm eager to pick up whatever is
        necessary to get the job done.
